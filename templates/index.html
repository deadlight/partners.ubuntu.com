			<h2>Driving innovation on devices and PCs</h2>
			<p>Ubuntu re-invents how users engage with content and services on smartphones, making it quicker and easier to discover and access. We invite OEMs and carriers to get involved in bringing this new mobile user experience to consumers. Consider a rare opportunity to help shape the future of smartphones, either as a phone OEM partner or via the <a href="/programmes/phone-carrier">Ubuntu Carrier Advisory Group.</a> Thanks to Canonical&rsquo;s <a href="/programmes/hardware">OEM</a> and <a href="/programmes/retail">retail</a> partners, Ubuntu has been available pre-installed on PCs all over the world, for several years. The same underlying OS will soon be available on smartphones and tablets, as well.</p>
